            <p>Here's a classic run down of the two stage opamp. As a circuit designer, these fundamentals should be engrained. At a reputable company, probably at least 75% of these would be asked.</p>    
			<ol>
				<li>Draw the basic CMOS two stage opamp.</li>
                <li>Label the inputs and outputs. Which input is the positive input?</li>
                <li>How do you know this is the correct positive input?</li>
                <li>Why would you use two stages instead of only one?</li>
                <li>What input differential pair FET type would you use? PFET or NFET? Why?</li>
                <li>In DC normal operation, What is the input resistance?</li>
                <li>In DC normal operation, What is the output resistance?</li>
                <li>What are the input and output voltage operating ranges/swings?</li>
                <li>If the input voltages are equal, and set such that all the transistors are in saturation. What is the voltage at the gate of the second stage input?</li>
                <li>What is the DC open loop gain?</li>
                <li>How would you increase the gain?</li>
                <li>Does increasing the 1st stage current increase or decrease the gain? Why is that?</li>
                <li>What is the dominant pole of a Miller compensated two stage opamp?</li>
                <li>What is the Miller compensation?</li>
                <li>What is the second dominant pole?</li>
                <li>What is the third dominant pole?</li>
                <li>Why do people usually not worry about the third pole?</li>
                <li>Is it possible to do o</li>
                <li>How much attenuation and phase shift does one pole give?</li>
                <li>For one pole, can the phase shift reach 90 degrees?</li>
                <li>What is the gain bandwidth product of the two stage opamp?</li>
                <li>Where is the second stage zero?</li>
                <li>Is this zero good or bad? Why?</li>
                <li>Do you know techniques to deal with this zero?</li>
                <li>If a nulling resistor is used, do you use a resistor or transistor?</li>
                <li>Would you put this resistor or transistor on the left or right side of the compensation capacitor? Why?</li>
                <li>What can you do to make your two stage opamp more stable?</li>
                <li>What is the positive slew rate?</li>
                <li>What is the negative slew rate?</li>
                <li>How can you increase slew rate?</li>
                <li>What is the common mode rejection ratio (CMRR)?</li>
                <li>Does CMRR get better or worse as you increase frequency? Why?</li>
                <li>What is power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)?</li>

                <li>How would you decrease random mismatch? What drawbacks are there?</li>
                <li>How does each transistor in the first stage contribute to the input-referred noise?</li>
                <li>How would you decrease the input-referred noise? What are the drawbacks?</li>
                <li>Explain the difference between flicker and thermal noise.</li>
                <li>Floorplan a two stage opamp layout.</li>
